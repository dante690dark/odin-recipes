    <h1>MeMe's Pasta Fagioli</h1>
    <img src="../assets/pasta.webp" alt="pasta image" />
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      MeMe's fagioli recipe features white cannellini beans, ditalini pasta with
      vegetables, lean hamburger, and herbs simmered in vegetable juice and
      chicken broth. It is similar to Italian chili, like Olive Garden's Pasta
      Fagioli, and even better on the second day.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 thin slice onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 stalk celery, diced</li>
      <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 (32 ounce) bottle tomato-vegetable juice cocktail (such as V8®)</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups ditalini pasta</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the
        hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Use a slotted
        spoon to transfer beef to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; discard
        grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat; sauté onion,
        celery, and carrot until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and sauté
        until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir vegetable juice cocktail, chicken
        broth, parsley, basil, oregano, and black pepper into vegetable mixture;
        bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer soup for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
        ditalini pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet
        firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir beef and cannellini beans into soup; cook and stir until soup is
        heated through, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon about 1/3 cup pasta into each serving bowl; ladle soup over pasta
      </li>
    </ol>
